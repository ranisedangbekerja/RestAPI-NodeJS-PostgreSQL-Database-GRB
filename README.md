**What is PostgreSQL?**

PostgreSQL, often referred to as "Postgres," is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). It is known for its robustness, extensibility, and standards compliance. Key features of PostgreSQL include:

1) Open Source: Freely available and modifiable.
2) Advanced Features: Supports advanced data types, full-text search, and GIS extensions.
3) ACID Compliance: Ensures reliable transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
4) Extensibility: Users can define their own data types, operators, and indexes.
5) Concurrency: Uses multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for high levels of concurrent processing.
6) Security: Includes robust security features such as authentication, authorization, SSL, and auditing.
7) Replication and Backup: Supports various types of replication and has tools for backup and restoration.
8) Performance: Optimized for performance with advanced indexing, partitioning, and parallel query processing.
9) Community and Ecosystem: Strong community support and a rich ecosystem of extensions and tools.
